# Benchmark-of-Typescript-Projects

Run the linesOfCode script by navigating to a project and running
1. node ../../scripts/linesOfCode.js

Right now you have to install the projects yourself
1. cd projects
2. git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n?tab=readme-ov-file#readme

next steps:
1. create a script that will pull all 20 projects we want to use at the same time
2. create a scipt to track build time
